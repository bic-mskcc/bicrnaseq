# bicrnaseq

This R package was written to facilitate RNASeq analysis including 
  - read count normalization
  - differential expression analysis using DESeq
  - data visualization

NOTE: this is the first iteration of this package and most functions are currently written to be used specifically within the BIC RNASeq pipeline. Plans for future versions include more flexible functions that will be able to be used independently of the pipeline.
